  <p>Running Geeks is a group of programmers who like to jog on their lunch breaks. Their fearless leaders, Tammy and Kaz, created the group in hopes that it would inspire even the most timid of runners.</p>
  <p>We meet from 12 PM to 1 PM every Tuesday and Thursday, starting from the 16th floor of 1201 3rd Ave. Hope to see you there!</p>
